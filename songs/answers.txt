Based on the average of each metric, energy (0.659), valence (0.48), and danceability (0.71646),
I would characterize this individual (if this were a single listener) as someone who enjoys
dancing more so than happy songs or songs that have tempos compatible with faster beats per minute (such as
cycling music, or cardio).

I think that calculating the listener's aura of a listener based on the metrics of energy, valence, and danceability may
not be representative of the listener because we don't know if the listener has been influenced by other events not
measured in the database. I could also look more closely at methods of meaurement such as mode, to see if averages were
skewed due to extremes or outliers.
